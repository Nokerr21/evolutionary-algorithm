# evolutionary-algorithm
## Classic evolutionary algorithm

### Two main functions:
- **evolutionary_classic**
  - Perform the evolutionary algorithm to optimize a given function.
  - This function represents a classic evolutionary algorithm approach where a
    population of individuals evolves through reproduction and mutation processes
    to find an optimal or near-optimal solution to the optimization problem.
